ISO | IEC 27001 - A.6.3 - Information security awareness, education and training. 

## ðŸ“– Inspiration and Project Goal

October is traditionally recognized as Cybersecurity Awareness Month.
This initiative is held worldwide, and its purpose is to remind us that the human factor remains the most vulnerable part of any security system.

I was inspired by the idea of turning this global campaign into a practical project: to demonstrate how a phishing awareness training can be organized within a real company or an educational environment.

- Example phishing campaigns (emails, landing pages).

- Screenshots and explanations of each step.

- Sample reports with anonymized results.

## ðŸŽ¯ Target

The main objective is to raise awareness about phishing threats by showing:

- How phishing emails are crafted to look legitimate.

- How fake login pages trick users into giving away sensitive data.

- How reporting and analyzing results helps to build a security culture.
---
## âœ… Conclusion

Phishing remains one of the most common attack vectors.
Even simple awareness exercises can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks in real organizations.

This project proves that:

- Training doesnâ€™t require expensive tools â€” only planning and creativity.

- Regular simulations build stronger habits among employees.

- Security culture starts with people, not just technology.

PS! FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY
