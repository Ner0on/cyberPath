# ISO | IEC 27001 - A.6.3 - Information security awareness, education and training. 

## Objective

October is traditionally recognized as Cybersecurity Awareness Month.
This initiative is held worldwide, and its purpose is to remind us that the human factor remains the most vulnerable part of any security system.

I was inspired by the idea of turning this global campaign into a practical project: to demonstrate how a phishing awareness training can be organized within a real company or an educational environment.
