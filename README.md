## Objective
From Web Development to Cybersecurity â€” after working in web development I discovered a passion for security and am now transitioning into practical security roles (SOC, red teaming, penetration tester).
This repository contains my study materials, labs, write-ups, and small projects demonstrating hands-on skills.
